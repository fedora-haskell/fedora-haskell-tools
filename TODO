- counts package list too (otherwise all)
- don't "== ==" deps until confirming unbuilt
- prevent building nvr downgrades
- detect started koji (srpm) tasks which are not builds yet
- chain --no-check (to replace koji)
- hledger think ghc-yesod-static-prof -> ghc-yesod-static -> ghc-yesod??
  - maybe rpmbuild-order too?
  - can cabal repl load libHS*.a? (if no .so)
- if unbumped subpackages check that release is bumped
- ghc.spec needs ghc-rpm-macros-extra to list libs

- fix fhmock shell dist

- better unbranched command: pkg branches
- warn about unpushed commit(s) without any bump
- filter out ghc-prof & ghc-doc deps, ghc-rpm-macros removal?, ghc-srpm-macros
- filter xmonad and pandoc-pdf from install

- bodhi overrides not happening for chain deps
- check update deps in candidate tag

# fhpkg
- license-check command
- -B dist is kind of nonsense
- library
- allow pkg/ or filter out '/'

(from fhpkg.hs):
- cache dist package lists?
- compare branch versions
- query-format string

deps query tool

Parallelize builds

--from (--continue) eg when conflict stops fhpkg

allow master instead of rawhide

check commands has all commands

count: option to query without updates

bodhi testing query?

# support chain-build

# git
* merge a/next koji build
- build new packages across branches

- debug output

# Building: rebuild*
- recursive building for koji and mock
- mockchain
- fedpkg git integration
- package sorting
- rebuilding
  - what can be built next
- copr support
- parallel/async building
- cache passwd for bodhi
- do not downgrade versions
- --liberal (allow failures)
- reconnect to koji when disconnected (build or wait-repo)

# checking
- Fedora x < Fedora x+1
- git out of sync with koji, updates

# Data generation and updating
- packages and Hackage
- dependencies and consumers

# Bugs
- URM bug checking and updating
  - stacks checking
- check review bugs

# missing
- which packages missing in dist to build package
- include version checks

# package ordering (sorting)
- use rpmbuild-order
